# Universal Patient Records

Presently there is no standard set of tools for hospitals, doctors' offices, and other health providers to share patient records to assure the most timely data is available when a patient needs care. There are many small scale experiments but no widespread solutions. In this project develop web services to capture patient records to cover doctors, hospital, and insurance needs. Assume an interface to univerally identify individuals to assure customer records are connected to the right individual.
